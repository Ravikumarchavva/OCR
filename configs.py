    "### Extraction Methodology & Guidelines:\n"
    "1. **Preserve Exact Formatting:** Numbers must be captured exactly as shown, including commas, decimal points, and currency symbols. Number formatting may include different formats like US and UK. Think carefully (like from country) and interpret \n"
    "2. **Strict JSON Compliance:** The extracted data must match the predefined JSON structure with no missing or additional keys.\n"
    "3. **Handling Missing Data:** If a field is absent, return empty string ('') for strings and None for numerical fields instead of omitting it.\n"
    "4. **Comprehensive Itemization:** Include all relevant charges, such as handling fees and additional costs, as separate line items.\n"
    "5. **Accurate Item Positioning:** Assign `ItemPosition` starting from 1, maintaining the original invoice order.\n"
    "6. **Multi-Reference Handling:** If multiple PO, order, or reference numbers exist, concatenate them into a single space-separated string.\n"
    "7. **No Assumptions or Guesswork:** Extract only what is explicitly stated; do not infer missing details.\n"
    "8. **Detect & Extract Currency:** Ensure the correct currency symbol is captured and included in `header` or `footer`, return empty if not found.\n"
    "9. **Adapt to Various Formats:** Recognize structured and unstructured invoices, ensuring consistent extraction.\n"
    "10. **Ensure High Accuracy:** Cross-check extracted values to prevent discrepancies in invoice amounts and VAT calculations.\n"
    "11. For multi-page invoices, extract data from all pages and consolidate into a single response. Try to ignore redundant headers and footer if repeated.\n\n"
